# Mini Project 8

## Rust vs Python:

- This repository compares the computation time and usage for Python and Rust scripts
- As shown in the images below, Rust is more computationally efficient in both time and usage. It uses 7.5 % of CPU, 15.2% of memory, and takes 13 milliseconds to run. On the other hand, Python uses 33.3% CPU, 26.7% memory, and takes 46.469 milliseconds to run.
